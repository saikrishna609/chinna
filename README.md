I am confident in my abilities to produce and while I prepare for the worst, I do the work necessary to tilt the odds that the best will happen.I am modest, but hard working and I consistently sets firm goals for myself.  Then, once I’ve defined the benchmarks, I take the necessary steps to achieve those milestones.I am a person who is able to control a situation rather than have a situation control me.I think positively and can execute on difficult tasks. I’m not an individual who needs to be micromanaged. Rather, when given a specific task, I can figure out the best ways to solve the problem in an autonomous manner.
